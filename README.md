Some of my work for Python practice 

1. Student database management 
          
         Using Python and SQL, Manage the students data by some simple operations like Add, Remove, Delete, Modify and Show a Student details.
         
2. Login and Registration

         ***This Project is completely based on Python File Handiling***
         
         Get userid and password and check for validation(using regression technique), If it is valid then check for availability of credentials in txt file, 
         If it is available then login successfull.
         
         if the userid and password are new (that is not available in txt file), go for registration.
